🚀 Project Overview

This project is a Streamlit-based Student–Internship Matching System that uses graph theory, similarity scoring, and matching algorithms to pair students and companies efficiently.
The system reads student skills and company requirements, computes a similarity matrix, and performs matching using:

Greedy Weighted Matching

Hungarian Algorithm

Hopcroft–Karp Matching

The app also visualizes the bipartite graph of students and companies and displays final matches in a clean table.
